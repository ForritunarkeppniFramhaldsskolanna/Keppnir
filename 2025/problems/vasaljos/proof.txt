We start with n vertices, n even

For n = 4 it is clear that if any two
are not connected by an edge they can
be an independent set of size 2, so for
n = 4 we need 6 edges

Now we assume n >= 6
We want the minimum number of edges such
that the resulting graph has maximum 
independent set (MIS) of size < n/2
Suppose you have some independent set and
add an edge, by removing either end point
we still have an independent set, so adding
an edge decreases it by at most 1
Thus to get below n/2 we must clearly have
at least n/2+1 edges

Thus to show the bound n/2+3 we just have to
show that at least 2 edges will not lower the MIS

Adding an edge to two isolated vertices reduces
the independent set size by 1

Adding an edge to create a K_2 component lowers the
MIS, but adding any edge to that K_2 component does
not lower the MIS. If we create a C_3 component that
does lower the MIS in the next step, but any other
move does not. Subsequently if we add any edge to
the C_3 it does not lower the MIS, so we have wasted
two edges.

Thus we may assume all components we create are
K_2, P_3 or C_3. Any C_3 or P_3 component has a
wasted edge, so if we have two or more of those
we are already done. Adding an extra edge to turn
a P_3 into a C_3 can only make the MIS smaller,
so we may assume we have zero or one C_3 and
the rest are isolated vertices or K_2.
But adding an edge to a K_2 component does not
Thus we either end up making n / 2 K_2 components,
or fail to decrease the number of independent sets
at least once. 

Then we have two cases. All K_2 components is not
enough to solve, as it still has a MIS of size n.
If we have one C_3 there will be one isolated vertex
as n is even, so we must have a MIS of size n as well.
Thus we get a contradiction, so we need at least
n/2 + 3 edges.
