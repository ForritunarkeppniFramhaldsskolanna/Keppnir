Atli is planning to take on the role of the game master
for a Pathfinder game with the competitive programming
society. Arnar has prepared a character with the rogue
class. Atli is trying how Arnar might pathfind during the
game, so he needs to know how many tiles Arnar can reach
in one turn.

Pathfinder movement involves the use of tiles, as the play
area is divided into a square grid of tiles. Moving one
square up, down, left or right counts as $5$ feet of
movement. Moving diagonally to another neighbouring
square works a little differently however. The first time
a player moves diagonally on their turn it counts as $5$
feet. Next time it counts as $10$ feet, then the time after
that as $5$ feet and so on.

\section*{Input}
The input contains one non-negative integer $n$, the maximum 
number of feet Arnar can move in a single turn.

\section*{Output}
Print the number of tiles Arnar can reach.
The starting tile should be included in the count.

\section*{Scoring}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Group & Points & Constraints \\ \hline
1     & 25   & $n \leq 50$\\ \hline
2     & 25   & $n \leq 1\,000$\\ \hline
3     & 25   & $n \leq 1\,000\,000$\\ \hline
4     & 25   & $n \leq 10^{18}$\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
