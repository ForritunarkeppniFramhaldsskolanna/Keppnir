Jón and Gunna argue sometimes about what colour a particular
thing is. Is the wall green or a yellowish green, is the dress
blue or gold and so on. To solve this problem they have obtained
a measuring device that measures the reflecting light in red, green and
blue and outputs three numbers.
This has however not solved the problem because now they
simply disagree on which values correspond to which colour.
Thus they now need a program which takes care of this issue.

All three values are integers from $0$ to $255$ and we
denote them by $R$, $G$ and $B$.
If $R$ is strictly greater than the other values the answer 
is \texttt{raudur}.
If $G$ is strictly greater than the other values the answer
is \texttt{graenn}.
If $B$ is strictly greater than the other values the answer
is \texttt{blar}.
If $R = G$ and $B$ is strictly smaller than the other values
the answer is \texttt{gulur}.
If $R = B$ and $G$ is strictly smaller than the other values
the answer is \texttt{fjolubleikur}.
If $G = B$ and $R$ is strictly smaller than the other values
the answer is \texttt{blagraenn}.
If all values are equal to $0$ the answer is \texttt{svartur}.
If all values are equal to $255$ the answer is \texttt{hvitur}.
If all values are equal, but not equal to $0$ nor $255$, the
answer is \texttt{grar}.
Otherwise if none of the above applies the answer is
\texttt{othekkt}.

\section*{Input}
The input consists of a single line with three integers
$R$, $G$ and $B$ which are separated by spaces.
It will hold that $0 \leq R, G, B \leq 255$.

\section*{Output}
Output the colour that the values correspond to, as
described above.

\section*{Scoring}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Group & Points & Constraints \\ \hline
1     & 50   & $R, G$ and $B$ are different. \\ \hline
2     & 50   & No further constraints. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
