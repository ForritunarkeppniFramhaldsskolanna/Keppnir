Hafliði has been a regular at Mahjong Pizza's Thursday-offer since its debut in 1993. The offer
consists of a single pizza with two toppings for $1\,000$ ISK, that is until January 2021 when it increased by $100$ ISK and
has done so every year since. Hafliði wants you to write a program that tells him how much the offer costs in the year $y$
given this pattern.

\section*{Input}
First and only line contains a single integer $y$.

\section*{Output}
Write a single line containing the price of a Thursday-offer in the year $y$.

\section*{Scoring}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Group & Points & Constraints \\ \hline
1     & 20   & $y = 2\,020$ \\ \hline
2     & 20   & $2\,020 \leq y \leq 2\,024$ \\ \hline
3     & 30   & $2\,020 \leq y \leq 9\,999$ \\ \hline
4     & 30   & $1\,993 \leq y \leq 9\,999$ \\ \hline
