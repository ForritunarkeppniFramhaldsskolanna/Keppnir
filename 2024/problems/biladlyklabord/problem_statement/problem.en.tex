Sigurjón's keyboard stopped working the other day when he accidentally spilled soda all over it.
After this the keyboard has started, likely as an act of revenge,
to sometimes type a character multiple times when Sigurjón presses a key.
Sigurjón is furious over his keyboard's attitude and will not talk about anything else.
You see that Sigurjón will not ever do anything about this and to fix things you intend
to give him a program that will filter out these key replication.

\section*{Input}
The input is a single line consisting of $n$ lower case ASCII letters along with spaces.

\section*{Output}
Print $s$ except all adjacent duplicate characters have been removed.
That is to say, the output should never contain the same symbol twice in a row.

\section*{Scoring}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Group & Points & Constraints \\ \hline
1     & 40   & $1 \leq n \leq 100$, the same symbol will never appear more than twice in a row in the input. \\ \hline
2     & 40   & $1 \leq n \leq 100$. \\ \hline
3     & 10   & $1 \leq n \leq 100\,000$, the same symbol will never appear more than twice in a row in the input. \\ \hline
4     & 10   & $1 \leq n \leq 100\,000$. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
