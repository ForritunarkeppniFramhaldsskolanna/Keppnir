Bjarki forgot his wallet when he went out to eat with Hlynur.
Hlynur paid for him and told Bjarki that he could use the service \emph{Monnei} to pay it back.
Bjarki thought Monnei had the highest transaction fee, higher than the other services \emph{Fjee} and \emph{Dolladollabilljoll}.
He told Hlynur that he would transfer the money using the service with the lowest transaction fee.
He needs your help to determine the correct service though.

\section*{Input}
The input consists of three lines.
The first line consists of a single integer $a$, the transaction fee on Monnei.
The second line consists of a single integer $b$, the transaction fee on Fjee.
The third line consists of a single integer $c$, the transaction fee on Dolladollabilljoll.

\section*{Output}
Output the name of the service with the lowest transaction fee in a single line.

\section*{Scoring}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Group & Points & Constraints \\ \hline
1     & 100    & $1 \leq a, b, c \leq 10^9$ \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
