Sammi's favorite number is $7$. He is so infatuated by it that everything he does revolves around the number $7$. Sammi is also a Hackintosh confectionary enthusiast.

Sammi recently got a box of Hackintosh confectioneries with $n$ pieces.
Each piece was labeled with a unique number between $1$ and $n$.
Sammi eats some assortment of pieces if and only if the sum of all of the pieces ends in $7$.
Sammi wants to know how many different possible assortments are edible.

\section*{Input}
The input is one line, the integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^9$), the size of the box.

\section*{Output}
The output is one line, amount of different possible edible assortments.
Since the answer can be very large, you should output it modulo $10^9+7$.

Group & Points & Constraints \\ \hline
1     & 20     & $1 \leq n \leq 20$ \\ \hline
2     & 25     & $1 \leq n \leq 10^6$, $n$ is a multiple of 10 \\ \hline
3     & 25     & $1 \leq n \leq 10^6$ \\ \hline
4     & 15     & $1 \leq n \leq 10^{15}$, $n$ is a multiple of 10 \\ \hline
5     & 15     & $1 \leq n \leq 10^{15}$ \\ \hline
