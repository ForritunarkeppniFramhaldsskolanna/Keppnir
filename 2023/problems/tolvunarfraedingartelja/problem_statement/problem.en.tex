Computer scientists count a bit different from normal people.
Most people start counting at $1$, then go to $2$, and after that $3$ follows and so forth.
But the first number according to computer scientists is $0$.
Therefore the second number is $1$ and the $1\,337$-th number is $1\,336$.

\section*{Input}
Input consists of one line with one integer $n$.

\section*{Output}
Output the $n$-th number, according to computer scientists.

\section*{Scoring}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Group & Points & Constraints \\ \hline
1     & 100  & $1 \leq n \leq 10^9$ \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
